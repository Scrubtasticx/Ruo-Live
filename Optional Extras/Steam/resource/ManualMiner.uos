////////////
// This macro was made to ease the pain of mining.
// It will target the tile in the direction that you're facing.
// It will use sturdy shovels first, then shovels, then pickaxes.
// It assumes that the organizing agent "orebeetle" exists.
// The "orebeetle" organizer should include each of the 4 ore types, ingots, and granite rocks (if applicable)
// It also assumes that your beetle is set as your mount.
// This macro was crafted with love and sealed with a kiss by Bagger
